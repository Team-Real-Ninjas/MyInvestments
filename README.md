## App Evaluation
- **Category:** Personal Finance/ Blog
- **Story:** Analyzes users investment choices, and allows them to montior them in various ways. The user can then decide to create blog posts about their learnings and help retain knowledge.
- **Market:** Any individual that has investments could choose to use this app, and to keep it a secure, they will have a secure login.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep they are into their personal finances, and what exactly they’re looking/monitoring for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with creating the home page so users can manage/monitor/and blog about the BTC, ETH, GLD, and SLVR stocks, then perhaps this could evolve into a news/portoflio platform this will broaden its usage. Large potential for use with local news sites(Direct users to their site), local blogs, and BTC/ETH Platforms.
